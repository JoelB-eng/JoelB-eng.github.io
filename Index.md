# Project 1:
- Project 1 was a solo project dealing with water system violations in the state of Nebraska
- Data was selected and narrowed donoe based of of community size and water system type
- In order for the code to properly work, the Project 1 ipynb code file and the fromatted Nebraska violations csv are needed
# Project 2:
- Project 2 was a group project and dealt with using python to solve statics problems
- The proper way to create functions was explored
- To access the code properly, the Project 2 ipynb file is needed
# Project 3:
- Project 3 was a group project dealing with traffic and transportation data
- Project 3 explored the use of graphs and how to customize them
- To properly acces the code, the Project 3 ipynb file and the NGSIM and NHTS csv files are needed
# Project 4:
- Project 4 was a group project dealing with the NRI risk assessment
- The groups were tasked with creating a cutom risk metric and comparing it to the NRI to look for bias
- Skills such as dealing with null values and creating graphs were built upon
- To access the code, the Project 4 ipynb file and the cleaned Nebraska and cleaned Iowa csv files are needed
# Project 5:
- Project 5 was a group project that was a culimination of all of the learned skills
- The group was tasked with completing a python code that could perform various functions on W shaped beams
- New packages were introduced that the group had to find on Github
- Skills such as functions and graphs were built upon and refined
- To access the code properly, the Project 5 ipynb file and the Wshapes csv file are needed
